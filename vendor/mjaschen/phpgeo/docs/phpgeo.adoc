== Introduction

_phpgeo_ is a small PHP library which provides abstractions to geographical
coordinates (including support for different ellipsoids), polylines
("GPS Tracks"), polygons, bounds, and more. _phpgeo_ allows you to perform
different calculations with these abstractions, as distances, track
lengths, etc.

_phpgeo_ is developed by https://www.marcusjaschen.de/[Marcus Jaschen] and all
https://github.com/mjaschen/phpgeo/graphs/contributors[contributors].

_phpgeo_ is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3

_phpgeo_ is now ready to be used in your project!

== API Documentation

Detailed https://phpgeo.marcusjaschen.de/api/[API documentation] is available.

== Geometries

_phpgeo_ provides several geometry classes:

* `<<Coordinate>>`
* `<<Line>>`
* `<<Polyline>>`
* `<<Polygon>>`

A Coordinate represents a geographic location, i. e. it contains a latitude
and a longitude - together with an so called Ellipsoid.

A Line consists of two coordinates, while polylines and polygons are built
from two or more coordinates.

=== Coordinate

The `Coordinate` class is the most important class of phpgeo and provides the
base for all features. It's a representation of a geographic location and
consists of three parts:

- Geographic Latitude
- Geographic Longitude
- Ellipsoid

Geographic latitude and longitude values are float numbers between
-90.0 and 90.0 (degrees latitude) and -180.0 and 180.0 (degrees longitude).

The Ellipsoid is a representation of an approximated shape of the earth and
is abstracted in its own <<Ellipsoid>> class.

=== Line

A line consists of two points, i. e. instances of the `Coordinate` class.

==== Length

The `Line` class provides a method to calculate its own length. The method
expects an instance of a class which implements the `DistanceInterface`.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Distance\Haversine;
use Location\Line;

$line = new Line(
    new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5),
    new Coordinate(52.6, 13.4)
);

$length = $line->getLength(new Haversine()); <1>

printf("The line has a length of %.3f meters\n", $length);
----

<1> `Haversine` is one of the currently two available classes for
distance calculation. The other one is named `Vincenty`.

The code above will produce the output below:

----
The line has a length of 13013.849 meters
----

==== Bearing

The bearing of an instance can be calculated using the `getBearing()` method.
An instance of `BearingInterface` must be provided as method argument.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Bearing\BearingEllipsoidal;
use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Line;

$line = new Line(
    new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5),
    new Coordinate(52.6, 13.4)
);

$bearing = $line->getBearing(new BearingEllipsoidal()); <1>

printf("The line has a bearing of %.2f degrees\n", $bearing);
----

<1> `BearingEllipsoidal` is one of the currently two available classes for
bearing calculation. The other one is named `BearingSpherical`.

The code above will produce the output below:

----
The line has a bearing of 328.67 degrees
----

This ist the so called _initial bearing._ There exist another bearing angle,
called the _final bearing._ It can be calculated as well:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Bearing\BearingEllipsoidal;
use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Line;

$line = new Line(
    new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5),
    new Coordinate(52.6, 13.4)
);

$bearing = $line->getFinalBearing(new BearingEllipsoidal());

printf("The line has a final bearing of %.2f degrees\n", $bearing);
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
The line has a final bearing of 328.59 degrees
----

See <<Bearing between two points>> for more information about bearings.

=== Polyline

A polyline consists of an ordered list of locations, i. e. instances of
the `Coordinate` class.

==== Create a polyline

To create a polyline, just instantiate the class and add points:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polyline;

$polyline = new Polyline();
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(54.5, 12.5));
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(55.5, 14.5));
?>
----

It's possible to add points to the end of the polyline at every time.

==== Segments

It's possible to get a list of polyline segments. Segments are returned as an
array of `Line` instances.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polyline;

$track = new Polyline();
$track->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$track->addPoint(new Coordinate(54.5, 12.5));
$track->addPoint(new Coordinate(55.5, 14.5));

foreach ($track->getSegments() as $segment) {
    printf(
        "Segment length: %0.2f kilometers\n",
        ($segment->getLength(new Haversine()) / 1000)
    );
}
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
Segment length: 232.01 kilometers
Segment length: 169.21 kilometers
----

==== Length

Length calculation is described in the <<Distance and Length>> section.

==== Reverse Direction

It's possible to get a new instance with reversed direction while the
original polyline stays unchanged:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polyline;

$track = new Polyline();
$track->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$track->addPoint(new Coordinate(54.5, 12.5));

$reversed = $track->getReverse();

print_r($reversed);
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
Location\Polyline Object
(
    [points:protected] => Array
        (
            [0] => Location\Coordinate Object
                (
                    [lat:protected] => 54.5
                    [lng:protected] => 12.5
                    [ellipsoid:protected] => Location\Ellipsoid Object
                        (
                            [name:protected] => WGS-84
                            [a:protected] => 6378137
                            [f:protected] => 298.257223563
                        )

                )

            [1] => Location\Coordinate Object
                (
                    [lat:protected] => 52.5
                    [lng:protected] => 13.5
                    [ellipsoid:protected] => Location\Ellipsoid Object
                        (
                            [name:protected] => WGS-84
                            [a:protected] => 6378137
                            [f:protected] => 298.257223563
                        )

                )

        )

)
----

=== Polygon

A polygon consists of an ordered list of locations, i. e. instances of
the `Coordinate` class. It's very similar to a polyline, but its start
and end points are connected.

==== Create a polygon

To create a polygon, just instantiate the class and add points:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polygon;

$polygon = new Polygon();
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(54.5, 12.5));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(55.5, 14.5));
?>
----

It's possible to add points to the end at every time.

==== Get list of points

`getPoints()` is used to get the list of points, the number of points can be
retrieved by calling `getNumberOfPoints()`:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DMS;
use Location\Polygon;

$polygon = new Polygon();
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(54.5, 12.5));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(55.5, 14.5));

printf("The polygon consists of %d points:\n", $polygon->getNumberOfPoints());

foreach ($polygon->getPoints() as $point) {
    echo $point->format(new DMS()) . PHP_EOL;
}
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
The polygon consists of 3 points:
52° 30′ 00″ 013° 30′ 00″
54° 30′ 00″ 012° 30′ 00″
55° 30′ 00″ 014° 30′ 00″
----

==== Segments

It's possible to get a list of polygon segments. Segments are
returned as an array of `Line` instances.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Distance\Haversine;
use Location\Polygon;

$polygon = new Polygon();
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(54.5, 12.5));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(55.5, 14.5));

foreach ($polygon->getSegments() as $line) {
    printf("%0.3f m\n", $line->getLength(new Haversine()));
}
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
232011.020 m
169207.795 m
339918.069 m
----

==== Length/Perimeter

Length calculation is described in the <<Distance and Length>> section.

==== Geofence

It's possible to check if a geometry object (point, line, polyline,
polygon) lies inside a polygon. The documentation can be found in
the <<Geofence>> section.

==== Reverse Direction

It's possible to get a new instance with reversed direction while the
original polygon stays unchanged:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polygon;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;

$polygon = new Polygon();
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(64.1, - 21.9));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(40.7, - 74.0));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(33.9, - 118.4));

$reversed = $polygon->getReverse();

foreach ($reversed->getPoints() as $point) {
    echo $point->format(new DecimalDegrees(', ')) . PHP_EOL;
}
----

The code above produces the output below:

----
33.90000, -118.40000
40.70000, -74.00000
64.10000, -21.90000
52.50000, 13.50000
----

=== Bounds

=== Ellipsoid

An ellipsoid is a mathematically defined approximation of the earth's surface.

An ellipsoid is defined by two parameters:

* the semi-major axis _a_ (equatorial radius)
* the semi-minor axis _b_ (polar radius)

_a_ and _b_ together define the flattening of the ellipsoid _f_:

latexmath:[f = \frac{a-b}{a}]

NOTE: _phpgeo's_ ellipsoids are defined by _a_ and _1/f_ instead of _a_
and _b_. That's not a problem because each of the three values can be
calculated from the other two.

_phpgeo_ supports arbitrary ellipsoids. _WGS-84_ is used as default when
no other ellipsoid is given. For day-to-day calculations it's not needed
to care about ellipsoids in the most cases.

It's possible to create an instance of the Ellipsoid class either by
specifing a name or by providing the three parameters _name,_ _a_, and _1/f_.

[source,php]
----
use Location\Ellipsoid;

$ellipsoid = Ellipsoid::createDefault('WGS-84'); <1>

printf(
    "%s: a=%f; b=%f; 1/f=%f\n",
    $ellipsoid->getName(),
    $ellipsoid->getA(),
    $ellipsoid->getB(),
    $ellipsoid->getF()
);

$ellipsoid = new Ellipsoid('GRS-80', 6378137, 298.257222); <2>

printf(
    "%s: a=%f; b=%f; 1/f=%f\n",
    $ellipsoid->getName(),
    $ellipsoid->getA(),
    $ellipsoid->getB(),
    $ellipsoid->getF()
);
----

<1> Create ellipsoid instance from one of the default configurations
<2> Create custom ellipsoid by providing name, _a_, and _1/f_

The code above will produce the output below:

----
WGS-84: a=6378137.000000; b=6356752.314245; 1/f=298.257224
GRS-80: a=6378137.000000; b=6356752.314133; 1/f=298.257222
----

Please take a look into the https://github.com/mjaschen/phpgeo/blob/master/src/Location/Ellipsoid.php#L45[`Ellipsoid` source file]
for a list of pre-defined ellipsoids.

== Calculations

=== Distance and Length

==== Distance Between Two Coordinates (Vincenty's Formula)

Use the calculator object directly:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Distance\Vincenty;

$coordinate1 = new Coordinate(19.820664, -155.468066); // Mauna Kea Summit
$coordinate2 = new Coordinate(20.709722, -156.253333); // Haleakala Summit

$calculator = new Vincenty();

echo $calculator->getDistance($coordinate1, $coordinate2);
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
128130.850
----

or call the `getDistance()` method of a Coordinate object by injecting
a calculator object:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Distance\Vincenty;

$coordinate1 = new Coordinate(19.820664, -155.468066); // Mauna Kea Summit
$coordinate2 = new Coordinate(20.709722, -156.253333); // Haleakala Summit

echo $coordinate1->getDistance($coordinate2, new Vincenty());
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
128130.850
----

==== Distance Between Two Coordinates (Haversine Formula)

There exist different methods for calculating the distance between
two points. The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_haversines[Haversine formula]
is much faster than Vincenty's method but less precise:

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Distance\Haversine;

$coordinate1 = new Coordinate(19.820664, -155.468066); // Mauna Kea Summit
$coordinate2 = new Coordinate(20.709722, -156.253333); // Haleakala Summit

echo $coordinate1->getDistance($coordinate2, new Haversine());
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
128384.515
----

==== Length of a Polyline

phpgeo has a polyline implementation which can be used to calculate the
length of a GPS track or a route. A polyline consists of at least two points.
Points are instances of the `Coordinate` class.

For more details about polylines/GPS tracks see the <<Polyline>> section.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polyline;
use Location\Distance\Vincenty;

$track = new Polyline();
$track->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$track->addPoint(new Coordinate(54.5, 12.5));

echo $track->getLength(new Vincenty());
----

==== Perimeter of a Polygon

The perimeter is calculated as the sum of the length of all segments.
The result is given in meters.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Distance\Vincenty;
use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polygon;

$polygon = new Polygon();
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(10, 10));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(10, 20));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(20, 20));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(20, 10));

echo $polygon->getPerimeter(new Vincenty());
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
4355689.472
----

=== Bearing and Destination

phpgeo can be used to calculate the bearing between two points and to
get a destination point for a given start point together with a bearing
angle and a distance.

Multiple calculation algorithms are supported. Currently phpgeo provides
methods for calculations with a _spherical_ earth model and with an
_ellipsoidal_ model. The spherical calculations are very fast, compared
to the ellipsoidal methods. The ellipsoidal algorithms are a bit more
precise on the other hand.

==== Bearing between two points

Given two points, it's possible to calculate the bearing angled between
those points.

phpgeo can calculate the initial bearing (bearing as seen from the first
point) and the final bearing (bearing as seen approaching the destination
point).

===== Calculation with a spherical earth model

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Bearing\BearingSpherical;
use Location\Coordinate;

$berlin = new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5);
$london = new Coordinate(51.5, -0.12);

$bearingCalculator = new BearingSpherical();

$startTime = microtime(true);
var_dump($bearingCalculator->calculateBearing($berlin, $london));
var_dump($bearingCalculator->calculateFinalBearing($berlin, $london));
$endTime = microtime(true);
printf("Time elapsed: %0.6f s\n", ($endTime - $startTime));
----

The code above will produce the following output:

----
double(268.60722336693)
double(257.85494586285)
Time elapsed: 0.000285 s
----

===== Calculation with an ellipsoidal earth model

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Bearing\BearingEllipsoidal;
use Location\Coordinate;

$berlin = new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5);
$london = new Coordinate(51.5, -0.12);

$bearingCalculator = new BearingEllipsoidal();

$startTime = microtime(true);
var_dump($bearingCalculator->calculateBearing($berlin, $london));
var_dump($bearingCalculator->calculateFinalBearing($berlin, $london));
$endTime = microtime(true);
printf("Time elapsed: %0.6f s\n", ($endTime - $startTime));
----

The code above will produce the following output:

----
double(268.62436347111)
double(257.87203657292)
Time elapsed: 0.000304 s
----

Both calculations finish in roughly the same time. One would expect the
second calculation to be clearly slower than the first one. It seems
the exit condition for the iteration is reached quite fast. There might
exist other conditions where the ellipsoidal calculation is noticeable
slower.

==== Destination point for given bearing and distance

As an example, starting from Berlin, calculate the destination point in
56.1 km distance with an initial bearing of 153 degrees:

[source,php]
----
<?php
use Location\Bearing\BearingEllipsoidal;
use Location\Bearing\BearingSpherical;
use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;

$berlin = new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5);

$bearingSpherical = new BearingSpherical();
$bearingEllipsoidal = new BearingEllipsoidal();

$destination1 = $BearingSpherical->calculateDestination($berlin, 153, 56100);
$destination2 = $bearingEllipsoidal->calculateDestination($berlin, 153, 56100);

echo "Spherical:   " . $destination1->format(new DecimalDegrees()) . PHP_EOL;
echo "Ellipsoidal: " . $destination2->format(new DecimalDegrees()) . PHP_EOL;
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
Spherical:   52.04988 13.87628
Ellipsoidal: 52.05020 13.87126
----

Oh, look, what a http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.0499&mlon=13.8762#map=13/52.0499/13.8762[beautiful spot on earth] it is. ;-)

==== Final Bearing for a calculated destination

phpgeo can calculate the final bearing angle for a given starting point,
an initial bearing, and the distance to the destination.

[source,php]
----
<?php
use Location\Bearing\BearingEllipsoidal;
use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;

$berlin = new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5);

$bearingEllipsoidal = new BearingEllipsoidal();

$finalBearing = $bearingEllipsoidal->calculateDestinationFinalBearing($berlin, 153, 56100);

var_dump($finalBearing);
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
float(153.29365182147)
----

=== Perpendicular Distance

The _perpendicular distance_ is defined as the shortest distance between a point
and a line (in the two-dimensional plane) respectively between a point and a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle[great circle] on a spherical surface.
With _phpgeo_ it is possible to calculate the perpendicular distance between a
point (instance of the `<<Coordinate>>` class) and a line (instance of the
`<<Line>>` class). A line is defined by two coordinates, exactly as a great
circle -- both are interchangeable in this case.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Line;
use Location\Utility\PerpendicularDistance;

$point = new Coordinate(52.44468, 13.57455);
$line = new Line(
    new Coordinate(52.4554, 13.5582),
    new Coordinate(52.4371, 13.5623)
);

$pdCalc = new PerpendicularDistance();

printf(
    "perpendicular distance: %.1f meters\n",
    $pdCalc->getPerpendicularDistance($point, $line)
);
----

The code above will produce the output below:

----
perpendicular distance: 936.7 meters
----


=== Geofence

_phpgeo_ has a polygon implementation which can be used to determinate
if a geometry (point, line, polyline, polygon) is contained in it or not.
A polygon consists of at least three points.

WARNING: The calculation gives wrong results if the polygons crosses
the 180/-180 degrees meridian.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polygon;

$geofence = new Polygon();

$geofence->addPoint(new Coordinate(-12.085870,-77.016261));
$geofence->addPoint(new Coordinate(-12.086373,-77.033813));
$geofence->addPoint(new Coordinate(-12.102823,-77.030938));
$geofence->addPoint(new Coordinate(-12.098669,-77.006476));

$outsidePoint = new Coordinate(-12.075452, -76.985079);
$insidePoint = new Coordinate(-12.092542, -77.021540);

var_dump($geofence->contains($outsidePoint)); // returns bool(false) the point is outside the polygon
var_dump($geofence->contains($insidePoint)); // returns bool(true) the point is inside the polygon
----

=== Transformations and Processing

==== Simplifying a polyline

Polylines can be simplified to save storage space or bandwidth.

_phpgeo_ provides two implementations for simplifying a polyline.

The first implementation uses the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer–Douglas–Peucker_algorithm[_Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm_] (also known as _Douglas-Peucker algorithm_). The other
implementation examines the bearings of the polyline segments and removes
a segment when its bearing angle is similar to the bearing angle of its
predecessor segment. I named it the _Delta-Bearing algorithm_.

===== Ramer-Douglas-Peucker Algorithm

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;
use Location\Polyline;
use Location\Processor\Polyline\SimplifyDouglasPeucker;

$polyline = new Polyline();
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(10.0, 10.0));
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(20.0, 20.0));
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(30.0, 10.0));

$processor = new SimplifyDouglasPeucker(1500000); <1>

$simplified = $processor->simplify($polyline);

foreach ($simplified->getPoints() as $point) {
    echo $point->format(new DecimalDegrees()) . PHP_EOL;
}
----

<1> remove all points which perpendicular distance is less
than 1,500,000 meters (1,500 km) from the surrounding points.

The code above produces the output below:

----
10.00000 10.00000
30.00000 10.00000
----

===== Delta-Bearing Algorithm

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;
use Location\Polyline;
use Location\Processor\Polyline\SimplifyBearing;

$polyline = new Polyline();
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(10.0, 10.0));
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(20.0, 20.0));
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(30.0, 10.0));

$processor = new SimplifyBearing(90); <1>

<1> The constructor argument is the minimum required angle between two
adjacent polyline segments so that no points will be removed. If the
bearing angle difference is less that the given value, the middle point will
be removed from the resulting polyline.

The code above produces the output below:

----
10.00000 10.00000
30.00000 10.00000
----

The following image shows both a polyline and its simplified version. The
simplification was done with the Delta-Bearing Algorithm with a threshold angle
of 20 degrees. The original polyline is painted in blue, the simplified polyline
is magenta.

== Formatting and Output

=== Coordinates

You can format a coordinate in different styles.

==== Decimal Degrees

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;

$coordinate = new Coordinate(19.820664, -155.468066); // Mauna Kea Summit

echo $coordinate->format(new DecimalDegrees());
----

The code above produces the output below:

----
    19.82066 -155.46807
----

The separator string between latitude and longitude can be configured via constructor argument, as well as the number of decimals (default value is 5 digits):

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;

$coordinate = new Coordinate(19.820664, -155.468066); // Mauna Kea Summit

echo $coordinate->format(new DecimalDegrees(', ', 3));
----

The code above produces the output below:

----
    19.821, -155.468
----

==== Degrees/Minutes/Seconds (DMS)

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DMS;

$coordinate = new Coordinate(18.911306, -155.678268); // South Point, HI, USA

$formatter = new DMS();

echo $coordinate->format($formatter) . PHP_EOL;

$formatter->setSeparator(", ")
    ->useCardinalLetters(true)
    ->setUnits(DMS::UNITS_ASCII);

echo $coordinate->format($formatter) . PHP_EOL;
----

The code above produces the output below:

----
    18° 54′ 41″ -155° 40′ 42″
    18° 54' 41" N, 155° 40' 42" W
----

==== Decimal Minutes

This format is commonly used in the Geocaching community.

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalMinutes;

$coordinate = new Coordinate(43.62310, -70.20787); // Portland Head Light, ME, USA

$formatter = new DecimalMinutes();

echo $coordinate->format($formatter) . PHP_EOL;

$formatter->setSeparator(", ")
    ->useCardinalLetters(true)
    ->setUnits(DecimalMinutes::UNITS_ASCII);

echo $coordinate->format($formatter) . PHP_EOL;
----

The code above produces the output below:

----
    43° 37.386′ -070° 12.472′
    43° 37.386' N, 070° 12.472' W
----

==== GeoJSON

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\GeoJSON;

$coordinate = new Coordinate(18.911306, -155.678268); // South Point, HI, USA

echo $coordinate->format(new GeoJSON());
----

The code above produces the output below:

[source,json]
----
{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-155.678268,18.911306]}
----

=== Polylines

You can format a polyline in different styles.

==== GeoJSON

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polyline;
use Location\Formatter\Polyline\GeoJSON;

$polyline = new Polyline;
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(52.5, 13.5));
$polyline->addPoint(new Coordinate(62.5, 14.5));

$formatter = new GeoJSON;

echo $formatter->format($polyline);
----

The code above produces the output below:

[source,json]
----
{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[13.5,52.5],[14.5,62.5]]}
----

=== Polygons

You can format a polygon in different styles.

==== GeoJSON

[source,php]
----
<?php

use Location\Coordinate;
use Location\Polygon;
use Location\Formatter\Polygon\GeoJSON;

$polygon = new Polygon;
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(10, 20));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(20, 40));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(30, 40));
$polygon->addPoint(new Coordinate(30, 20));

$formatter = new GeoJSON;

echo $formatter->format($polygon);
----

The code above produces the output below:

[source,json]
----
{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[20,10],[40,20],[40,30],[20,30]]}
----

== Parsing and Input

=== Coordinates Parser

_phpgeo_ comes with a parser for several types of coordinate formats.
The parser works as a factory which creates an instance of the
`Coordinate` class.

==== Supported Formats

**Decimal Degrees** with or without *cardinal letters*,
with or without a comma as separator, with or without
whitespace between values and cardinal letters:

    52.5, 13.5
    52.5 13.5
    -52.5 -13.5
    52.345 N, 13.456 E
    N52.345 E13.456

**Decimal Minutes** with or without cardinal letters, with
or without degree and minute signs, with or without a comma
as separator, with or without whitespace between values
and cardinal letters:

    N52° 12.345, E13° 34.567
    52° 12.345′ N, E13° 34.567′ E
    52 12.345, 013 34.567
    -52 12.345, -013 34.567

The https://github.com/mjaschen/phpgeo/blob/master/tests/Location/Factory/CoordinateFactoryTest.php[unit test]
shows some more examples.

==== Example

[source,php]
----
use Location\Factory\CoordinateFactory;
use Location\Formatter\Coordinate\DecimalDegrees;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$point = CoordinateFactory::fromString('52° 13.698′ 020° 58.536′');

echo $point->format(new DecimalDegrees());
----

The code above produces the output below:

    52.22830 20.97560
